The goal of this project is a lot of things, the main idea: 

- An app that will help you improve at chess by reviewing your previous games

Simple. Except that's not all it is. I also wanna explore decentralized app development. Puting users in control of their data. So this app will (attempt to) refrain from using centralized servers or databases to store data or run computations. The [@Fission](https://fission.codes/) suite of tools will help __a lot__ with this.

## How does it work

1. Go to [the website](https://chesski.vercel.app/), choose a username and connect
2. Upload [pgn files](https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-pgn#what-is-pgn) of chess games you have played, or want to learn from 
3. Use the chessboard to load postions you want to study
4. A list of moves that have been played in that position will be displayed along with their frequency and your performance in the subsequent position

## Work in progress

A cautionary note: this app is a work in progress! I expect it to change rapidly as the idea developes further. __Feddback and feature requests are encouraged.__ Currently I am building this as a tool that will be useful to me, if you have ideas on how it could be more useful yto **YOU** please lkm :)
